  abstract = "Opportunities to directly study the founding of a human
              population and its subsequent evolutionary history are rare.
              Using genome sequence data from 27 ancient Icelanders, we
              demonstrate that they are a combination of Norse, Gaelic, and
              admixed individuals. We further show that these ancient
              Icelanders are markedly more similar to their source populations
              in Scandinavia and the British-Irish Isles than to contemporary
              Icelanders, who have been shaped by 1100 years of extensive
              genetic drift. Finally, we report evidence of unequal
              contributions from the ancient founders to the contemporary
              Icelandic gene pool. These results provide detailed insights into
              the making of a human population that has proven extraordinarily
              useful for the discovery of genotype-phenotype associations.",
