This package was initially constructed based on the Allen Ancient DNA Resource (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data, version 37.2).

This package does not represent the originally published dataset, due to the removal of 20 genotypes of Indigenous individuals from Taiwan. These genotypes were generated from cell lines commercially available from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, which in turn were produced from samples collected before 1995. In 2010, it became public through Taiwanese Indigenous Television that samples collected between 1992 and 1996 were taken with verbal consent only from the village head, not with proper individual informed consent (Munsterhjelm, M. 2014. Living Dead in the Pacific: Contested Sovereignty and Racism in Genetic Research on Taiwan Aborigines. UBC Press.). Any associated data and analyses are therefore controversial in Taiwan, particularly in Indigenous communities, and were removed from the package.
