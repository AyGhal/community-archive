  abstract = "While the series of events that shaped the transition between
              foraging societies and food producers are well described for
              Central and Southern Europe, genetic evidence from Northern
              Europe surrounding the Baltic Sea is still sparse. Here, we
              report genome-wide DNA data from 38 ancient North Europeans
              ranging from ~9500 to 2200 years before present. Our analysis
              provides genetic evidence that hunter-gatherers settled
              Scandinavia via two routes. We reveal that the first Scandinavian
              farmers derive their ancestry from Anatolia 1000 years earlier
              than previously demonstrated. The range of Mesolithic Western
              hunter-gatherers extended to the east of the Baltic Sea, where
              these populations persisted without gene-flow from Central
              European farmers during the Early and Middle Neolithic. The
              arrival of steppe pastoralists in the Late Neolithic introduced a
              major shift in economy and mediated the spread of a new ancestry
              associated with the Corded Ware Complex in Northern Europe.",
