  abstract  = "The early Iron Age (800 to 450 BCE) in France, Germany and
               Switzerland, known as the `West-Hallstattkreis', stands out as
               featuring the earliest evidence for supra-regional organization
               north of the Alps. Often referred to as `early Celtic',
               suggesting tentative connections to later cultural phenomena,
               its societal and population structure remain enigmatic. Here we
               present genomic and isotope data from 31 individuals from this
               context in southern Germany, dating between 616 and 200 BCE. We
               identify multiple biologically related groups spanning three
               elite burials as far as 100 km apart, supported by
               trans-regional individual mobility inferred from isotope data.
               These include a close biological relationship between two of the
               richest burial mounds of the Hallstatt culture. Bayesian
               modelling points to an avuncular relationship between the two
               individuals, which may suggest a practice of matrilineal
               dynastic succession in early Celtic elites. We show that their
               ancestry is shared on a broad geographic scale from Iberia
               throughout Central-Eastern Europe, undergoing a decline after
               the late Iron Age (450 BCE to ~50 CE). Gretzinger et al. examine
               genetic evidence from 31 Iron Age individuals in southern
               Germany and find that this early Celtic society probably had a
               dynastic system of matrilineal inheritance, with a network of
               well-connected elites covering a broad territory.",
