This package contains data published in Gretzinger et al. 2022 (Nature). The data were generated partially in Boston (David Reich's lab) and at the MPI-EVA in Leipzig.

All individuals with Poseidon IDs that start with three letters followed by three numbers (e.g. ADN010) were generated at the MPI-EVA. All individuals with Poseidon IDs starting with an I, followed by letters were produced in Boston.

Low coverage and samples excluded from (some) analyses in the paper have a `_lc` in the group name.

Sample Duplicates are indicated using the relationship fields in Janno.
